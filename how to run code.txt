Good question — the error in your terminal:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'


means Python can’t find the Flask library in your current environment.

Let’s fix it step-by-step 👇

🧩 Why This Happens

You’re running:

py .\app.py


but your virtual environment (venv) isn’t activated, so Python is using the system interpreter, not the one where Flask should be installed.

✅ Solution Steps
1. Activate your virtual environment

In your terminal, run:

On Windows (PowerShell):

.\venv\Scripts\activate


You should see (venv) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

2. Verify Flask is installed

Once activated, run:

pip show flask


If you see details like Name: Flask, it’s installed.

If not, install it:

pip install flask flask-cors flask-socketio flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate


(These are all the libraries used in your app.py.)

3. Run your app again

Now execute:

python app.py


or

py app.py


If Flask is installed in your venv, this time it should start without the ModuleNotFoundError.
